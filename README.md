# Music_Knowledge_Systems
Two projects applying knowledge graphs and ontologies to improve music recommendation systems and structure music-related data. They were developed for ECE NTUA's "Knowledge Systems and Technologies" course during the academic year 2021-2022. 

It should be noted that the projects were carried out in Google Colab Notebooks. The paths that are set in the `.ipynb` files need to be updated accordingly for your local environment.

## First Project
### Music Recommendation System Using Knowledge Graphs
This project builds a music recommendation system that leverages knowledge graphs to provide more personalized and context-aware recommendations. Traditional music recommendation systems rely on collaborative filtering or content-based approaches, but this system enhances recommendations by:

- Incorporating semantic relationships between artists, genres, and other music attributes.
- Using graph-based reasoning to suggest songs based on deeper connections, such as common influences or lyrical themes.

## Second Project
### Music Ontology Project
The goal of this project is to create a music ontology that structures and formalizes the relationships between various musical elements, including:

- Artists, albums, genres, instruments, and songs.
- Using RDF/OWL standards to model the domain, making it easy to query and integrate with other knowledge bases.
- The ontology allows better data sharing, retrieval, and integration across different music platforms, improving search engines, recommendation engines, and AI systems.

## Project Structure
Each of these projects includes the following components:
- The `.ipynb` file with the Implementation Code
- A `datafiles` folder which contains all the input files that were provided in the project description.
- A `output` folder that contains all the output files generated during the execution of the code.
